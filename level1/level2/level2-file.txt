To navigate to a room 1 on level 3 we first need to enter the main door /, then make our way to level 3 level3/ and from there enter the room1. Hence, the absolute path to this particular room within a building is /level3/room1. From here, if we wish to visit room2 also on level3 we first need to leave our current location that is room1 by entering ../ and then include room's name room2. We took a relative path to room2 which in this case is ../room2. We were already on level 3, so there was no need to leave the entire building and take absolute path via main entrance
